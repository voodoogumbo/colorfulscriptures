# Screenshot Guide

To add a Scripture Analysis Example screenshot to the README:

## Taking the Screenshot

1. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open http://localhost:3000**

3. **Create a good example:**
   - Choose a well-known scripture like:
     - **1 Nephi 3:7** (shows obedience/faith themes)
     - **John 3:16** (shows love/salvation themes)
     - **2 Nephi 2:25** (shows joy/purpose themes)
     - **Alma 32:21** (shows faith/hope themes)

4. **Configure colors** (optional):
   - Adjust the color scheme to show meaningful theological categories
   - Make sure the colors are visually distinct

5. **Run analysis:**
   - Click "Color Scriptures!" button
   - Wait for AI analysis results to appear
   - Ensure results show color suggestions with justifications

6. **Take screenshot:**
   - Capture the full interface showing both input form and results
   - Include the color scheme panel on the left
   - Make sure text is readable and interface looks clean
   - Recommended size: 1200px wide minimum

## Adding Screenshot to Repository

1. **Save screenshot as:**

   ```
   colorfulscriptures/docs/screenshot.png
   ```

2. **Optimal specifications:**
   - Format: PNG (for crisp text)
   - Width: 1200-1600px
   - Height: 800-1200px
   - File size: Under 1MB if possible

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add docs/screenshot.png
   git commit -m "Add application screenshot example"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Placeholder Screenshot

If you want to push the repository now and add a real screenshot later, we can create a placeholder that indicates where the screenshot will go.

The README currently references:

```markdown
![Scripture Analysis Example](colorfulscriptures/docs/screenshot.png)
```

This will show a broken image until you add the actual screenshot file.
